## Shyam BV intro
Welcome to my website. This is a place for me to share projects I have been evolved with. A little about me. I earned my Batchelors degree at Anna university. You can find my dissertation on Github. I have a strong interest in R, reproducible research, and statistics driven in part to the fact that I was a software engineer for 8 years (working mostly in BI).
